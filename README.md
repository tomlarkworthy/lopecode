# Lopecode

A Lopebook is a hermetic, self-hosted, self-sustainable, recursively exportable, offline-first, file-first, web-based reactive open-source programming substrate built on Observable runtime. It is an ideal platform for building programmable, reactive applications that work offline, that require no runtime to be installed.

The ["Tour of Lopecode"](https://tomlarkworthy.github.io/lopecode/notebooks/@tomlarkworthy_lopecode-tour.html) is an interactive introduction to some of the things you can build in Lopebooks

The ["vision statement"](https://tomlarkworthy.github.io/lopecode/notebooks/@tomlarkworthy_lopecode-vision.html) explains the endgoal in more detail and is itself a lopebook you can hack around with.

The ["audio sequencer"](https://tomlarkworthy.github.io/lopebooks/notebooks/@tomlarkworthy_sequencer.html) is an example of a non-trivial application that remembers its state.


The blog post [reactive reflective testing](https://tomlarkworthy.github.io/lopebooks/notebooks/@tomlarkworthy_reactive-reflective-testing.html) explains how reactive programming can super charge unit testing and development. It also shows the value of using lopebooks are interactive blog posts.
