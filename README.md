# Lopecode

a hermetic, self-hosted, self-sustainable, recursively exportable, offline-first, file-first, web-based reactive open-source programming substrate built on Observable runtime

Check the work-in-progress [here](https://tomlarkworthy.github.io/lopecode/@tomlarkworthy_lopepage.html)

The "vision statement" is a [lopcode document](https://tomlarkworthy.github.io/lopecode/notebooks/@tomlarkworthy_lopecode-vision.html)
