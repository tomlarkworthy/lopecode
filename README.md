# Lopecode

Lopecode is a web-based modable programming environment where a small microkernal core defines minimal features to enable live coding applications to be built.

The kernal has no UI and defines mechanisms for
1. hot code swapping
2. modules
3. reactive dataflow programming model

Everything else is implemented in userspace, including an editor and a UI which can be live edited. There is no external source code, instead the runtime itself is decompiled on demand, according to a runtime-is-the-source-of-truth principle.

One userspace module, the Exporter, can self-serializes the entire runtime to a single HTML file, so you can use it offline from the local filesystem. There are no dependancies other than a web browser.


The ["Tour of Lopecode"](https://tomlarkworthy.github.io/lopecode/notebooks/@tomlarkworthy_lopecode-tour.html) is an interactive introduction to some of the things you can build in Lopebooks

The ["vision statement"](https://tomlarkworthy.github.io/lopecode/notebooks/@tomlarkworthy_lopecode-vision.html) explains the endgoal in more detail and is itself a lopebook you can hack around with.

The ["audio sequencer"](https://tomlarkworthy.github.io/lopebooks/notebooks/@tomlarkworthy_sequencer.html) is an example of a non-trivial application that remembers its state.


The blog post [reactive reflective testing](https://tomlarkworthy.github.io/lopebooks/notebooks/@tomlarkworthy_reactive-reflective-testing.html) explains how reactive programming can super charge unit testing and development. It also shows the value of using lopebooks are interactive blog posts.
